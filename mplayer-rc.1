.SH NAME
\&mplayer\-rc \- MPlayer/MPV wrapper enabling use of a VLC remote

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mplayer\-rc
\&[mplayer\-rc or mplayer/mpv options] [files/URLs]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\&MPlayer-RC enables remote control of the MPlayer, MPlayer2 and MPV
\&command line media players from a VLC remote (i.e. an application
\&written to use VLC's HTTP control interface). It is designed to work
\&specifically with the Android application Android-VLC-Remote which can
\&be obtained from F-Droid:

\&    <https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.peterbaldwin.client.android.vlcremote>

\&or directly from the Android-VLC-Remote author at

\&    <https://code.google.com/p/android-vlc-remote>

\&Other applications speaking the VLC HTTP protocol may work but are not
\&tested. VLC itself is not required since MPlayer-RC acts as a
\&translator, forwarding VLC commands received from the remote to the
\&backend player and returning responses back.

\&To use MPlayer-RC, invoke it in the same way you would invoke
\&MPlayer. For example:

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&mplayer-rc \-ao alsa track1.mp3 track2.mp3
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&or

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&mplayer-rc \-playlist file
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&You can then control the player using Android-VLC-Remote on your
\&Android device.

\&Android-VLC-Remote will prompt you for a password which you need to
\&inform MPlayer-RC about beforehand. For this you can use the command
\&line flag \-password or put the line

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&password=...
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&in the file ~/.mplayer-rc. Similarly, you can also use

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&port=...
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&to change the default listening port from 8080.

\&By default, MPlayer-RC uses MPlayer/MPlayer2 as its backend player. To
\&use MPV instead you can use \-backend mpv on the command line,
\&backend=mpv in the config file, or rename the mplayer-rc binary to
\&mpv-rc.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-V
\&show version, license and further information
.TP 8
.BI \-backend " backend"
\&set backend as the backend player (default mplayer)
.TP 8
.BI \-password " pass"
\&use pass as the Android-VLC-Remote password
.TP 8
.BI \-port " port"
\&use port as the listening port for VLC commands (default 8080)
.TP 8
.B \-remap\-commands
\&use alternate actions for some VLC commands

.SH FILES
\&~/.mplayer-rc \- configuration file

.SH NOTES
\&Files and URLs are not passed through to the backend player as command
\&line arguments and are instead retained by MPlayer-RC since they are
\&needed to implement shuffle. The backend is started by MPlayer-RC in
\&slave mode without any files/URLs on its command line and then asked
\&to play tracks via its slave mode protocol.

\&As a consequence of this there is currently a restriction on the
\&format of a playlist file. It must be UTF-8 "one file/URL per line"
\&format or a .m3u8 file. This is because it is not passed through using
\&the \-playlist flag and is parsed instead by MPlayer-RC, whose parsing
\&is less sophisticated.

\&If the \-remap-commands flag is given to MPlayer-RC or
\&remap-commands=yes is set in the config file then some buttons within
\&Android-VLC-Remote are repurposed to be more useful:

\&    • The "Audio track" button is repurposed to cycle through OSD modes.

\&    • The "Subtitle track" button is repurposed to rewind by 10 seconds.

\&    • The "Aspect ratio" button is repurposed to fast forward by 10 seconds.

\&One purpose of remapping is to have an easy way to quickly fast
\&forward and rewind when Android-VLC-Remote is used in portrait mode on
\&a small screen. The alternative otherwise is forwarding/rewinding
\&using the progress slider which is quite fiddly.

\&The following features of Android-VLC-Remote are working:

\&    • Playing tab: All features (play, pause, stop, forward, back,
\&loop, repeat, volume, shuffle, fullscreen, aspect toggle etc).

\&    • Playlist tab: Selecting tracks works as normal.

\&The following features of Android-VLC-Remote do not work:

\&    • Library tab.

\&    • DVD tab.

\&    • Metadata: The metadata passed through to the information box is
\&just the filename (as "title").
