.SH NAME
\&mplayer\-rc \- MPlayer wrapper enabling remote control from a VLC client

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mplayer\-rc
\&[mplayer\-rc or mplayer options] [files/URLs]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\&MPlayer-RC enables remote control of the MPlayer and MPlayer2 command
\&line media players from a VLC client. It is designed to work
\&specifically with the Android application Android-VLC-Remote which can
\&be obtained from F-Droid:

\&    <https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.peterbaldwin.client.android.vlcremote>

\&or directly from the Android-VLC-Remote author at

\&    <https://code.google.com/p/android-vlc-remote>

\&Other VLC clients may work but are not tested. VLC itself is not
\&required since MPlayer-RC acts as a translator, conveying "VLC
\&commands" received from the client to MPlayer and returning responses
\&back.

\&Invoke MPlayer-RC in the same way you would invoke MPlayer. For
\&example:

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&mplayer-rc \-ao alsa track1.mp3 track2.mp3
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&or

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&mplayer-rc \--playlist=file
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&You can then control MPlayer using Android-VLC-Remote on your Android
\&device.

\&Android-VLC-Remote will prompt you for a password which you need to
\&inform MPlayer-RC about beforehand. For this you can use the special
\&command line flag \--rc-password or put the line

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&rc-password=...
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&in the file ~/.mplayer/mplayer-rc. Similarly, you can also use

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&rc-port=...
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&to change the default listening port (8080) instead of using the
\&\--rc-port flag.

.SH FILES
\&~/.mplayer/mplayer-rc \- configuration file

.SH NOTES
\&Files and URLs are not passed through to MPlayer as command line
\&arguments and are instead retained by MPlayer-RC since they are
\&needed to implement shuffle. MPlayer is started by MPlayer-RC in
\&slave mode without any files/URLs on its command line and then asked
\&to play tracks via its slave mode protocol.

\&As a consequence of this there is currently a restriction on the
\&format of a playlist file. It must be UTF-8 "one file/URL per line"
\&format or a .m3u8 file. This is because it is not passed through to
\&MPlayer as a \--playlist=... flag and is parsed instead by MPlayer-RC,
\&whose parsing is less sophisticated than MPlayer's.

\&If the \--remap-commands flag is given to MPlayer-RC or
\&remap-commands=true is set in its config file then two buttons within
\&Android-VLC-Remote are repurposed to be more useful:

\&    • The "Audio track" button is repurposed to cycle through OSD modes.

\&    • The "Subtitle track" button is repurposed to rewind by 10 seconds.

\&Having the subtitle track button remapped is convenient when
\&Android-VLC-Remote is used in portrait mode on a small screen. The
\&alternative of rewinding using the progress slider is otherwise quite
\&fiddly.

\&The following features of Android-VLC-Remote are working:

\&    • Playing tab: All features (play, pause, stop, forward, back,
\&loop, repeat, volume, shuffle, fullscreen, aspect toggle etc).

\&    • Playlist tab: Selecting tracks works as normal.

\&The following features of Android-VLC-Remote do not work:

\&    • Library tab.

\&    • DVD tab.

\&    • Metadata: The metadata passed through to the information box is
\&just the filename (as "title").

\&In testing, MPlayer2 seems to be more responsive than MPlayer with
\&certain types of files. It is not known why this is.
