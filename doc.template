MPlayer-RC is an MPlayer wrapper enabling remote control from a VLC client.

{{.Synopsis}}

Description

MPlayer-RC enables remote control of the MPlayer and MPlayer2 command
line media players using a VLC client. It is designed to work
specifically with the Android application Android-VLC-Remote which can
be obtained from F-Droid:

  https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.peterbaldwin.client.android.vlcremote

or direct from the Android-VLC-Remote author at

  https://code.google.com/p/android-vlc-remote

Other VLC clients may work but are not tested. VLC itself is not
required since MPlayer-RC acts as a translator, conveying "VLC
commands" received from the Android client to MPlayer and returning
responses back.

Invoke MPlayer-RC in the same way you would invoke MPlayer. For
example:

  mplayer-rc -ao alsa track1.mp3 track2.mp3

or

  mplayer-rc --playlist=file

You can then control MPlayer using Android-VLC-Remote on your Android
device.

Android-VLC-Remote will prompt you for a password which you need to
inform MPlayer-RC about beforehand. For this you can use the special
command line flag --rc-password or put the line

  rc-password=...

in the file ~/.mplayer/mplayer-rc. Similarly, you can also use

  rc-port=...

to change the default listening port (8080) instead of using the
--rc-port flag.

Notes

Files and URLs are not passed through to MPlayer as command line
arguments and are instead retained by MPlayer-RC since they are
needed to implement shuffle. MPlayer is started by MPlayer-RC in
slave mode without any files/URLs on its command line and then asked
to play tracks via its slave mode protocol.

As a consequence of this there is currently a restriction on the
format of a playlist file. It must be UTF-8 "one file/URL per line"
format or a .m3u8 file. This is because it is not passed through to
MPlayer as a --playlist=... flag and is parsed instead by MPlayer-RC,
whose parsing is less sophisticated than MPlayer's.

The "Audio track" button within Android-VLC-Remote is repurposed to
cycle through OSD modes.

The "Subtitle track" button is repurposed to rewind by 10
seconds. This is convenient when somebody talks over a part of a film
and you need to quickly rewind. The alternative of rewinding using the
Android-VLC-Remote progress slider is quite fiddly.

The following features of Android-VLC-Remote are working:

  * Playing tab - All features (play, pause, stop, forward, back,
    loop, repeat, volume, shuffle, fullscreen, aspect toggle etc).

  * Playlist tab - Selecting tracks works as normal.

The following features of Android-VLC-Remote do not work:

  * Library tab

  * DVD tab.

  * Metadata - The metadata passed through to the information box is
    just the filename (as "title").

In testing, MPlayer2 seems to be more responsive than MPlayer with
certain types of files. It is not known why this is.
