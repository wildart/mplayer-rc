.SH NAME
\&mplayer\-arc \- wrapper for MPlayer enabling Android remote control

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mplayer\-arc
\&[mplayer\-arc or mplayer options] [files/URLs]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\&MPlayer-ARC enables remote control of the MPlayer and MPlayer2 command
\&line media players using an Android device (ARC meaning Android remote
\&control). It is designed to work specifically with the Android
\&application Android-VLC-Remote which can be obtained from

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&<https://f-droid.org>
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&or direct from the Android-VLC-Remote author at

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&<https://code.google.com/p/android-vlc-remote>
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&Other VLC remote clients may work but are not tested. VLC itself is
\&not required since MPlayer-ARC acts as a translator, conveying "VLC
\&commands" received from the Android client to MPlayer and returning
\&reponses back.

\&Invoke MPlayer-ARC in the same way you would invoke MPlayer. For
\&example:

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&mplayer-arc \-ao alsa track1.mp3 track2.mp3
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&or

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&mplayer-arc \--playlist=file
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&You can then control MPlayer using Android-VLC-Remote on your Android
\&device.

\&Android-VLC-Remote will prompt you for a password which you need to
\&inform MPlayer-ARC about beforehand. For this you can use the special
\&command line flag \--arc-password or put the line

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&arc-password=...
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&in the file ~/.mplayer/mplayer-arc. Similarly, you can also use

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&arc-port=...
.RE
.fi
.ft

\&to change the default listening port instead of using the \--arc-port
\&flag.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-V
\&show version, license and further information
.TP 8
.BI \-\-arc\-password " pass"
\&use pass as the Android-VLC-Remote password
.TP 8
.BI \-\-arc\-port " port"
\&use port as the listening port for VLC commands (default 8080)
.TP 8
.B \-\-mplayer\-help
\&display the MPlayer usage message

.SH FILES
\&~/.mplayer/mplayer-arc \- configuration file

.SH NOTES
\&Files and URLs are not passed through to MPlayer as command line
\&arguments and are instead retained by MPlayer-ARC since they are
\&needed to implement shuffle. MPlayer is started by MPlayer-ARC in
\&slave mode without any files/URLs on its command line and then asked
\&to play tracks via its slave mode protocol.

\&As a consequence of this there is currently a restriction on the
\&format of a playlist file. It must be UTF-8 "one file/URL per line"
\&format or a .m3u8 file. This is because it is not passed through to
\&MPlayer as a \--playlist=... flag and is parsed instead by MPlayer-ARC,
\&whose parsing is less sophisticated than MPlayer's.

\&The "Audio track" button within Android-VLC-Remote is repurposed to
\&cycle through OSD modes.

\&The "Subtitle track" button is repurposed to rewind by 10
\&seconds. This is convenient when somebody talks over a part of a film
\&and you need to quickly rewind. The alternative of rewinding using the
\&Android-VLC-Remote progress slider is quite fiddly.

\&The following features of Android-VLC-Remote are working:

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&* Playing tab \- All features (play, pause, stop, forward, back,
\&  loop, repeat, volume, shuffle, fullscreen, aspect toggle etc).
\&
\&* Playlist tab \- Selecting tracks works as normal.

\&The following features of Android-VLC-Remote do not work:

.ft CW
.nf
.RS 4
\&* Library tab
\&
\&* DVD tab.
\&
\&* Metadata \- The metadata passed through to the information box is
\&  just the filename (as "title").
.RE

\&In testing, MPlayer2 seems to be more responsive than MPlayer with
\&certain types of files. It is not known why this is.
